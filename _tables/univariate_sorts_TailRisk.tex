\captionsetup{font = footnotesize, justification = justified, width = \linewidth}
\caption*{Funds have been sorted into quintiles based on their
                        estimated TailRisk. For each quintile, a value weighted return
                        for month \textit{t+1} has been calculated using weights from
                        month \textit{t}. This gives 1 time series per quintile of value
                        weighted portfolio returns in month \textit{t+1}. The column 
                        'Returns' report the time average of these series. *, **
                        and *** indicate statistical significance at,
                        respectively, the 10\%, 5\% and 1\% significance level.
                        
                        Note that in the presence of tied TailRisk values, the first 
                        observation with that TailRisk value is ranked lower than the 
                        following observation with the same TailRisk value. This pattern
                        repeats in the presence of more than two ties.}
